The client is a Python library designed to facilitate and optimize the user experience with the Parcl Labs API. It handles searching, retrieving, and formatting the data for us, making it much easier to use our data by abstracting away complexity and allowing you to focus on building. As a reminder, while you can simply enter your `API_KEY`, it is recommended that you save it as an environment variable for added security.

You can find more information about the methods for the Parcl Labs Client [here](https://github.com/ParclLabs/parcllabs-python). In this case, we are interested in the [property search v2 endpoint](https://docs.parcllabs.com/reference/property_search_v2_v2_property_search_post-1), and for this example, we are getting all sales between $300,000 and $500,000 for single-family homes in the city of Pittsburgh, PA (`parcl_id`: `5377717`) that are between 2,000 and 4,000 square feet. In the example below, we define the necessary parameters to search for this information and then call the Parcl Labs Client to download the data for us. You will notice that we have a handful of additional parameters commented out; those help us narrow down our search, but for now, let's use the `parcl_ids`, `event_names`, `min_price`, and `max_price`, `property_types`, `min_sqft`, and `max_sqft`. \n",

The parameters defined in `search_params` are a critical tool on how to search for relevant information on the API.
