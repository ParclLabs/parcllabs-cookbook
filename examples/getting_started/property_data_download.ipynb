You can find more information about the methods for the Parcl Labs Client [here](https://github.com/ParclLabs/parcllabs-python). In this case, we are interested in the [property search v2 endpoint](https://docs.parcllabs.com/reference/property_search_v2_v2_property_search_post-1), and for this example, we are getting all sales between $300,000 and $500,000 for single-family homes in the city of Pittsburgh, PA (`parcl_id`: `5377717`) that are between 2,000 and 4,000 square feet. In the example below, we define the necessary parameters to search for this information and then call the Parcl Labs Client to download the data for us. You will notice that we have a handful of additional parameters commented out; those help us narrow down our search, but for now, let's use the `parcl_ids`, `event_names`, `min_price`, and `max_price`, `property_types`, `min_sqft`, and `max_sqft`. Additionally, we set the `include_property_details` to True, so every event record will also return property metadata. If you do not need the property metadata feel free to change this field to False. The parameters defined in `search_params` are a critical tool on how to search for relevant information on the API. They are designed to provide our users with the necessary control to make their search as wide or as narrow as they wish.\n",
