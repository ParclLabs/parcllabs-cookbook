# Welcome to the Lab ðŸ¥¼ðŸ§ª

Welcome to the Parcl Labs repository. This repository contains examples of how to use the Parcl Labs API. The Parcl Labs API is a real-time, advanced real estate analytics data technology. It accelerates time to analysis, shifting the 80% of time typically spent on data wrangling to analysis.

We open source all of our content off of [X](https://twitter.com/ParclLabs). How we do it is ðŸ‘‡

## Sign Up for an API Key

To use the Parcl Labs API, you need an API key. To get an API key, sign up at [Parcl Labs](https://dashboard.parcllabs.com/signup).

## Installation

The fastest ways to get started are with Binder or Google Colab. Google Colab is embedded directly in each notebook. It is substantially faster than Binder and our recommended way to get started the fastest.
